 ## Configuring Github Codespaces
 I have created a profile of codespace attributes that are automatically loaded to each codespace that I create. This is how you can do some of the same!
 
GitHub Codespaces are a powerful tool for developers to quickly set up cloud-hosted development environments. With just a few clicks, you can create a fully functioning workspace with all the essential tools and software you need to code, build, and deploy your projects in no time. 

In this guide, we'll show you how to configure GitHub Codespaces for your development needs. 

 ### Step 1: Create a GitHub Codespace 
First, log in to GitHub and navigate to the **Codespaces** tab in the left-hand menu. Click the **New Codespace** button to create a new workspace.

You'll be asked to provide some basic information about your workspace, including its name, language, and framework. Select the options that best fit your project's needs and click **Create**. 

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment 
Once your workspace is created, you can customize it with various tools and settings. You can add additional packages or software, configure the version control system, and adjust the environment variables as needed. 

To get started with configuration, click on the **Settings** tab in the navigation bar at the top of your workspace window. Here you'll find all of the available configuration options for your workspace.

### Step 3: Install Necessary Packages 
Your workspace may require certain packages or software for your project to run correctly. To install these packages, open up a terminal window from within your Codespace and use apt-get or any other package manager that is supported by your operating system. For example: 
```bash 
sudo apt-get install <package name> 
``` 

 Once you've installed all of the necessary packages for your project, you'll be ready to start coding!

 ### Step 4: Commit Your Changes 
 Once you're done configuring your workspace, make sure to commit your changes. This will ensure that your configuration is saved and can be reused in the future if necessary. 

To commit your changes, open up a terminal window and run the following command: 
```bash 
git add . 
git commit -am "Configured Codespace for <project name>" 
``` 

 This will add all of your configuration changes to a new commit in the repository associated with your workspace. Once the commit is complete, you'll be able to access it from any other connected devices or from within the Codespace itself.
