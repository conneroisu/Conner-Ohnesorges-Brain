The creation of NLP and text generation datasets are extremely impactual and has the potential to allow for researchers to train models that can automatically generate text. However, the creation of custom datasets is a teadious and slow process.

The text dataset aid is a helpful tool that can aid the creation of finetuning datasets for text generation models like GPT-3 by hand! This can make the text generated by your model after finetuning to be more personalized, detailed, or better formatted. Say no to dealing with menus through hotkey configurations!

This plugin can be used to quickly generate training data for NLP and text generation models. This would speed up research in these areas, as well as make it easier for practitioners to train these models.
